##General Information
**Drake HS is part of the North Conference** of the NorCal League. Most of our races are schedule for Saturday which means the students will have permission to leave early from school on Friday **only if** they have completed and submitted the Field Trip (Link to form) forms to Jolie Jacobs, Co-Director. If you have any questions about the forms or the schedule, please contact Jolie. 

**Please do not register for any races.** The Director will register and the team will pay for each rider a week before each race.

The **Race Pre-Ride** is not a mandatory ride but strongly encouraged to help the riders learn the course and build confidence before racing. In general, the pre-ride is the day before the race at 3:30pm.

**Recommended Lodging** is noted below and in most cases, discounted rates have been negotiated. Don’t wait to make your reservation – do it now! If you wait, you’ll just be sad that missed out on a great rate and getting to stay with the rest of the team. Details are noted under each race below. 

The **Team Dinners** are a great event for the entire family. All are welcome and encouraged to join the extended Drake MTB family for good cheer and camaraderie (and help calm some pre-race jitters.) Team dinner location is noted under the details for each race below.

**Food and Volunteer Sign up Sheets (go to new webpage)**
(Add link to Google Sign up sheets)
Please do not change anything or overwrite any of the cells. Look down the list of the appropriate race and add your name to a blank cell corresponding to the item you will bring and the Volunteer position you plan to fill. Then, take note of what you just volunteered for and enter it into your favorite reminder device.

Do please remember, breakfast items should be in the Pit Zone by 8:30am at the latest (give your item a ride with a friend if you know you just cannot get there that early) and do be sure to remember your shift.

If you have questions about any of the volunteer positions–like feed zone (most people don’t know much about this one, but it is quite easy)–contact your buddy or any of us long timers. We’re all happy to provide as much advice as you can stand to listen to.
