##### Come Help Support PELO and Drake MTB!!!

Alan Roberts **donates** his time, his staff, his washing machine, his dryer, his **EXPERTISE** to all of our riders. It is **time** to **GIVE BACK. BIG TIME!!!**

You don't even need to know how to ride a bike. As long as you can sit on a seat, you are golden. It that doesn't suit you, donate $35 and your bike will have your name on it. You don't even need to be on the seat, give us $35 and we will just put your name on the seat! Seriously!!! It is time to give back to this wonderful program!

Please email Margot Enbom at [margotenbom@gmail.com](mailto:margotenbom@gmail.com) to reserve your seat now.
