title: Region 2 Workshop
---

**Let's all be there** as cyclists/hikers/runners who want our trails to remain open — even advocate for more trails, so more people can enjoy the outdoors, by whatever non-motorized method.  If we all get pushed off our lovely, decades-old single-track walking trails onto fireroads in the blazing sun, whatever tiny amount of trail conflict exists in West Marin will only increase.

**DETAILS:** For Region 2 Road & Trail System Designation Workshop

**WHEN:** 1-4PM, Sat, Oct. 3, 2015
**WHERE:** Lagunitas School in San Geronimo (Multipurpose Room), #1 School Rd., just past the SG Valley Community Center @ 6350 Sir Francis Drake Blvd, San Geronimo, CA 94963

**More info** on the workshop will be published on this webpage as the workshop date nears. We’ll send an email to subscribers of this webpage when the info is put online. 

**Region 2** includes these 7 Open Space Preserves in west Marin: French Ranch, Maurice Thorner Memorial, Roy’s Redwoods, Gary Giacomini, Loma Alta, White Hill, Cascade Canyon.
