This video is so awesome. Thank you for your effort at the race and in front of the computer putting this together. Its such a great reminder of another reason the Drake MTB is so fantastic. There are some teams that have no girls, others that labor over getting just a few to join their team but Drake has 9 unbelievably smart, talented, beautiful, positive and skilled riders who contribute to every ride, race and win for Drake. To say we are lucky is an understatement. We are the envy of every team out there and for good reason. Our girls ROCK!
