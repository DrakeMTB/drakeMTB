title: Team Dues and Scholarships
---
# Hi Everyone,

It's time for team dues. As a club sport, Drake MTB receives no school funding, so annual dues and fundraisers are the financial foundation of the team. Dues help make up the difference between the income we raise from our team sponsors, clothing sales, bike raffle (thank you Sunshine Bikes), Iron Springs Give Back Tuesday (Nov 22), and the upcoming Piggbackr fundraising campaign and the expenses of running the program including coaches, race fees, events, and scholarships. A breakdown of the team budget can be found here: http://drakemtb.org/images/2017_budget.pdf.

Team dues for the 2016-2017 season are $350 and are due December 7.

Dues can be paid via Paypal (send $350 as a "friend" to DrakeMTBDues@gmail.com) or by check (payable to "Drake MTB" and mail to Philip Nicol, PO Box 495, San Anselmo CA 94979). This information can be found on our website at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGmI-vk2ad8dLRt2BA0XTWm1Cj1EHjzog01pnGqr3qLIEOgA/viewform

We are pleased to be able to offer a Scholarship Fund for those riders in need of some assistance to defray the expenses associated with team participation. Scholarship requests will be reviewed, awarded, and allocated by a scholarship committee. All applications, awards, and notifications well be held in strict confidence. Our scholarship funds are limited, and the number and amount of awards will be based on the number of requests made and individual needs. For more information and to request a scholarship, go to: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd3IXLRt7DjZA4b9HYtpFRuBuZxHeauVNy6z78pcf1DUENLg/viewform

Scholarship Requests are due November 28.

If you have any questions, please contact Philip Nicol (pnicol@mac.com) or me.
