Laguna Seca-Motorcycle Mayhem 
Wyatt Miceli  
DNF  

Non the less this race was interesting, exciting, and eye opening experience.  

Now, I'm not usually one to write these race reports, usually it's because I'm pretty whipped after races and fall asleep mid-way and forget to finish writing them (MY BAD) But I figured since  I only raced for about 6 minutes of the race I could bust it out and make this a first timer for this season. 

For starters,  thank you so much for all the support from family and friends on the team, even though most of you are basically family, for all of the adventures we have all had together riding. Also a big thanks to Trevor, just incase you didn't know the man is a miracle worker. As many of you know I have had back pain through many of the races and due to a recent crash I wasn't even sure if it was worth racing today, or if I should reserve  it for States. Thanks to him I was really able to loosen up and release pain, which mentally was a big step up. 

Being a previous gold medal-er on the course I can't lie but say I'm kinda a fan of all the killer uphill, flowy downhill and RACE CARS AND MOTORCYCLES that hall around the racetrack. 

Anyway back to the topic! So. The pre ride was just like any other, an easy spin around a well rain packed trail was a blast. Letting Jeffrey and Ronan, (AKA the chippy black hair one and the corky red head SOPHOMORE LEADER) lead was a good idea due to there great handling and easy to follow lines. I've been riding with these two fellas since the beginning of my riding time and always manage to have fun. After completing one lap we felt like we understood the course and with my back beginning to act up we called it a day. 

Waking up a 7 was a treat! Usually waking up at 6 I felt very well rested getting in that extra hour. I woke up to some Stevie Ray Vaughn and easily managed to leave the hotel on time. (A first for us!) Heading to the course I finally got hungry and ate a muffin and a banana, once arriving they were followed by a burrito and many sausages, plus Advil. 

I went over and checked in with Trevor and got primed up for racing. I did everything like I usually would even if I wasn't sure about racing just in case. My warmup felt surprising good and after that I knew I could back down or I'd be kicking my self until States. So there I went. After a talk with the Tam coaches (Thanks Sarah!) due to some interactions during the last race, the conversation on the starting like was pretty mediocre. But I didn't care, purely there to have fun and mess with awkward teenagers Walden and I sat and judged all the leaders bike. Many of them were very nice indeed but I was doing anything to keep my mind of racing and injury. After two, ten second countdowns we were off! Standing on the start line for 10 minutes doesn't help the warmup process is my legs but I figured I had a few time up Hurl hill to get that all sorted out. Falling back a few places off the bat was not mentally pleasing  but I knew I had to remain calm. Completing the starter loop was a flash and we began the descent. Dust was everywhere, I guess they never learned the art of using your front brake and managed to create quite the dust storm. Coming the first corner I back off the riders ahead of me to assure that I could see were the heck I was going. Now clearly that didn't work, they all decided to slow way down, in an attempt to pass I hung the corer hard, and needed the extra space to recover. That extra space was a pile of dead tree braces and launched me OTB, surprisingly far. As my body introduced its self to the ground I could tell I was immediately down for the count. After many attempts to get back up I finally noticed the gash on my knee and my inability to move it. 

So there I was, EMT on scene, with Charlie and a Tam coach as awesome back ups. After hearing that Dylan Harris also fell bad, we managed to keep the EMT's pretty booked up. With some bandaging and a 4X4 we finally managed to get up higher ground and off to the hospital. 

As I lay in this hospital bed I'm pretty bummed to be getting 34 stitches in my knee but happy that nothing is broken. (Wow did I learn how much I hate laughing gas, what a trip that was! A 15 minutes procedure felt like a life time.) Congrats to all those who really put it all out there today and brought this team to its victory. Wish I could be there to celebrate. A really quick shout out to Uma, Elise, Marya, Ronan, Dylan, Dean, Kyle, Otis, Logan, Gabe, Walden, Stella, and think you get the point of how amazing it is to be surrounded by such awesome riders and people. Happy Mothers Day!

1st Place 

Ok, so I was extremely nervous for this race. First off, my mom gave me the incredibly heavy information, which I already knew, that I had to finish this race no matter what if I wanted to go to states. She was like, "If you're bike breaks in half, you are walking the rest of the race." This did not help my nerves.

Nevertheless, when race day rolled around, I was ready to go. I warmed up with Wyatt and then I rolled over to the start line to get a front row spot in general staging. I achieved that and ended up starting in the 5th row back, behind Marcos. We had a quick conversation about which way he should move so that I could fly through to the front group and then Vanessa started counting down. When she said go, I clipped in and immediately went searching for ways to pass people. I got a little boxed in right at the start and didn't really get free until the start of the climb on the start lap. By the top of it, I was with the front group and settled into my spot in second wheel, behind Tyler. We went flying in to the first steep little climb and my legs weren't feeling as good as I'd hoped they would and I became very worried for the rest of the race. I told myself that they would feel better after the descent and continued behind Tyler. We began our first time down the descent which was very scary. I hadn't yet realized how fast Tyler was at descending until this moment. For a reference point, I looked back at my race file today and we hit 40 MPH at one point on the descent, which most of you will attest to being not very smooth. Anyway, we were flying down the descent and instantly our group had a gap. It was now just Tyler, myself, Liam, and Julian and we all knew it was going to stay that way until the end. There was a flurry of little attacks on the first climb up hurl hill, but mostly we stayed together going into the second lap. This time down the descent, Liam led it, with Julian behind him, then me and Tyler. This in no way slowed our pace down the descent and we started catching a lot of people this lap. We reached the last corner before the bottom and Julian took the wide line. I took that opportunity to pass him and put myself second behind Liam. Nothing changed until the top of hurl hill again. At the top of hurl hill though, we were all fighting for the second place position behind anyone. We were all trying to avoid riding into the wind, I ended up getting pushed into third and we started the little road climb again with the order, Liam, Julian, me, and Tyler. Right before we hit the dirt though, I passed Liam and Julian and put in a big surge effort to get to the top ahead of the rest of them so I could lead the descent. I did it and went flying into the descent trying to create as big a gap as I could. Right then, I caught Liam Jay and  group of 3 varsity riders. It was a struggle passing them and Liam and Julian caught up to me again. I dropped them again and had a 15 second lead coming to the bottom of the climb. I kept looking over my shoulder to see where they were and I could see that Julian had dropped Liam and was trying to catch me. I looked ahead of me again and saw Sam and that gave me a burst of energy to try and catch him, which I did, just as Julian caught me. I was OK with this and settled in to make sure that Liam didn't catch us as well. We flew up hurl hill and went through the feed zone together. I didn't necessarily want to be leading but I knew that if I let Julian go first, he might drop me. If this happened I knew that it would be very easy for Liam to catch me and my race would fall apart. My logic is a little bit skewed here but it worked out. Again, I led into the descent and it went much smoother passing people this time. We got to the bottom with the same lead over Liam and I heard Julian say, "He's catching us," but I was starting to fall apart. I struggled up the first part of the climb and saw Alec and was spurred to catch him. At the bottom of hurl hill, exactly what I thought was going to happen, happened. Julian went around me and tried to drop me. I jumped on his wheel, but he got a little gap on me. Some part of me told myself that this was it and I was going to get second again. Then I screamed to myself, "NO" and caught back up to him. I stayed right on his wheel and on the last part of hurl hill, he dropped me again. This moment will serve as a great one to give a PSA. I want to make sure that every rider understands how much cheering can help. I was dropped by Julian on hurl hill, but thanks mostly to all of you, I knew that I needed to put out a little more effort to catch back on. Even just a simple Woot! goes a long way. At the corner before the climb to the feed zone, Julian slowed way down to let me catch him. To everyone else, this may have seemed very strange but I knew exactly what he was doing. I passed him and tried to attack but realized that I didn't have the energy and now Julian was right on my wheel. We got to the top of the climb where the feed zone is and Julian was still on my tail. I knew that if I just rode to the finish, Julian would sprint around me and win. Luckily, thanks to watching years of professional road racing, I knew what to do. I slowed way down and weaved back and forth across the trail making sure that I could see Julian all the time. I must have looked like an idiot but it worked. This meant that when Julian attacked, I saw him do it. I went with him and we were next to each other going down the hill. Then, to my dismay, I saw that there was a rider in front of me. I thought that that was going to be it and I almost gave up, instead of giving up though, I jumped on Julian's wheel and sprinted to keep up with him. Then, just as it kicks up before the finish, I saw myself passing him and put in all the rest of the effort I had to sprinting to the finish. I threw my arms in the air and knew that this is what all the horrible intervals do for you.

This was a great experience and all of you did a great job out there, whether or not you were on the podium, or even finished the race. Thanks so much for cheering me on when I thought I couldn't go anymore. On to states!

Congratulations to the 2016 Norcal Champions Drake MTB!!!!

Eight consecutive Norcal Champs; 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016

This accomplishment reflects a total commitment to becoming the best rider you can be.  It shows how the team worked together to climb to the top throughout the 5 races that comprise the Norcal season. The riders knew when it was time to celebrate and when it was time to pull up the spandex and focus in order to improve that start, ignore those legs screaming to stop the pain or ride relentlessly to the top of hurl hill.  In many ways, the Norcal Championship is the true measure of excellence for it is not a one-day event. Instead, it reflects the team that is consistent and committed to the very end.

We began in October with Alan's hard and fun Pelo sessions and the Halloween team ride/party. We braved the ice-cold mornings for the forming ride/bike check event and finally kicked off the real training with the time trials up Loma Alto. Then began our Sunday rides, then weekday rides, our winter sport riders returned and *BOOM* started the long climb to the Championship win with race one.

Out the gate, defending last year’s title looked very challenging.  Woodcreek and Tam both returned with a vengeance and ammunition. Both have large teams with lots of depth.

The season was a rollercoaster. All 3 teams won a race and traded places on the podium with every new race. Drake riders suffered from horrible flu, injuries, mechanicals and continued to persevere.  We started into the final race with a slim lead over Woodcreek and Tam was within whispering distance. All three of us had a chance of taking the title.

How did Drake react to the challenge?

By making the podiums look like a Maverick's size wave of green that washed over it topped by 2 black-clad leaders in Ronan and Otis. (We didn't want to describe them as seals)

Let's surf this wave all the way down south and defend Drake's 2015 State Title.

7 more practices including Pelo to fine tune your skills to peak at States. Let's have some great rides and crush it in Los Olivos.

Very special congratulations to the 1st ever-undefeated Drake MTB rider in the Norcal season - Otis Lyons.

Both Dylan Harris and Wyatt Micelli are recovering from their injuries and wished they could have been there at the podium to celebrate. They were missed.

Howdy pirates,

This was possibly the most flawless race I've ever had.

I was very excited about racing at Laguna Seca, after asking many returners which race was their favorite and many of them saying that is was this one. After my hardest couple weeks of training of the entire season, the race finally rolled around. We drove up to the course and after a few minutes, I was on my pre-ride. By the end, I could tell it was an extremely short course with plenty of climbing and very fast descending, something I was looking forward to racing on.

As race day came, so did my nerves, almost more than in my other races since I now knew how terrible I was going to feel for the duration of the race, especially on one with this much climbing. I watched the girls race, and suddenly it was my turn. I had a great warm-up, as I knew just how hard to push myself in order to be at my peak by the race. Time flew by, and before I knew it we were off.

In the first couple seconds of racing, I had the ingenious idea of taking it a little slow to begin and save my energy to catch up on the climbs. As soon as we began the descent, I was in something like 20th place, and got stuck behind a group of kids going a lot slower than I would've liked. I passed a few, but it seemed like there was an endless number. Finally, as the climbing began I was towards the front of the pack, with Bridger just a little ways ahead of me. I stayed close behind him all the way through the climbs, until the end of hurl hill when the universe began to hate me.

Right around the feed zone, my chain fell off. Nothing huge, although with all the parents trying to tell me what to do and kids passing me right and left, the stress made it take me a minute or so to get it back on, and suddenly I was right behind the slow descenders once again. I knew I had to get ahead of them before we started our second lap, so I sprinted up to the front of the pack and managed to get back into a decent position. 

I flew through the downhill with no one to slow me down and eventually came upon some sophomores. I tried to pass Blake, but right before I could an extremely impatient D2 freshmen tried to pass him at the exact same time I did. The D2 freshmen passed on a dangerous part off the trail, and Blake had no choice but to swerve to his right so he didn't hit the kid, moving right into me, leaving me lying on the grass beside the trail. I immediately knew this race was going to be trashed. I saw my chain wrapped around my pedal, and felt a throbbing pain in my heel. Blake was fine and went on his way, after graciously offering to help me fix my bike. I quickly managed to get my chain back on, although after riding for a moment the pain in my heel was too much to ride with, so I began to walk my bike along the course, just trying to find someone to help me while dozens of riders passed by. Finally, I reached the top of a hill, and almost as if it was never there, the pain in my heel disappeared.

I began riding again, enraged with my bad luck, but knew that just by finishing I could help the team. I passed many kids, and finally reached the top of hurl hill for my second lap, finding a group of freshmen I could sprint to the end with, because I might as well finish strong.  As we came around the final turn, me and one other rider sprinted it out, with a few others close behind. 

As we neared the finish, a sophomore who had another lap to go tries to pass me, even though there was no room on the trail. Mr. Impatient, though, decided to try to pass me anyway. He ended up hitting my bar, knocking me over sideways with some of the most pain I've ever felt. I got up as fast as I could, and felt a burning pain in my elbow, but most of my attention was kept on my knee. Bloody and gruesome, I wanted to scream out in agony. Limping to the finish as many more kids passed me, I felt awful and could barely move. I finally made it, ending with 28th place.

As I said, possibly the most flawless race I could have. 

A huge congratulations to the entire team for bringing home another NorNorCal victory, and especially to Otis, Logan, Gabe, Kyle, Dylan, Uma, Ronan, Matthew, Calvin, Elise, Stella, and Marya for getting on the podium (wow that's a lot!)

Howdy all,
Congratulations to everyone for doing a fantastic job this year, we are the NorCal Champions!! We are going to kill it at states I know it!! It is such a treat for me to be part of this amazing team, and I have all of you to thank. THANK YOU!

Next, I would like to give Alec Levy O'brien a HUGE shoutout for letting me race his bike, which is a lot of fun to ride, and much more race worthy than my antique yeti. I think that this bike helped me a ton this race, both with my overall performance, and just how much fun I was having riding it. Another huge THANK YOU!

Coming into this race, I was dreading what I've heard was the toughest climb in the series, hurl hill. I hadn't pre ridden the course until Sunday morning, and so I had much more time to be stressed about the unknown. Once I had finished my pre ride, I realized that it was a super quick climb, and I would just grind away to the feed zone and then I would be half way already. After my pre ride, I couldn't help myself but ride around talking with everyone, cheering and exploring the venue. After a while I realized that I was wearing my legs down, and I was worried about that , but during the race I honestly didn't feel to bad at all. Anyways at the start, I was finally in call ups, so I told the front group “everyone try not to crash” maybe this helped, but thank god nobody crashed ahead of me, so I was able to get a good line going up the cement road. At the top, where the fire road started I was in 8th and I just decided, what the heck, I'll just pass as many people as I can before the single track. I passed two people, who were both good riders and I was scared they would pass later, but I will get to that. Going up the next cement limb I was sure somebody would pass me, so I just sprinted up it, only to get stuck behind the two best woodcreek riders who were going really slow, and suddenly the entire rest of the freshman were right behind me. Darn. Starting the downhill in 6th was good, although these woodcreek riders did slightly hold me back from keeping up with Logan. After the “technical” section was over, and we had the fast meadow singletrack to go before the climb, the woodcreek kids attacked which I thought was weird on a downhill, and they managed to get a small gap but nothing major, and by the time the climb started I was right behind them once again, with Kyle, and a redwood kid right behind me. I was seriously confused about what these woodcreek kids were doing going so slow up the climb, were they saving it, or had I just gotten better? Whatever it was, I knew Logan and the front pack were long gone.  Was stuck behind them, until the steep part, where Kyle and I passed. By the time I got to the top of the hill, I looked back, and saw Kyle, but behind him nobody was there, like the woodcreek kids had just given up. Well whatever, stay ahead, I'm in fourth! Passing through the the feed zone was the best thing that could have happened, everyone from drake was screaming at the top of their lungs, and it made me dig so much deeper. This was the same with the finish area, everyone was going crazy, THANKS GUYS!! So by the cement climb started again I had a decent gap on Kyle and I was already feeling good about this downhill. By the time I had went through the gate, I was completely of breath, but knew if I keep the effort up I could make more gains. So I pushed forward into the downhill, and proceeding safely, and fast as I could I was able to gain more and not crash. On the uphill I gave it the last of my energy, getting to hurl hill with a big gap behind me, and feeling really good about the race, going through the feed zone again I was super happy, looking back and seeing 5th place far enough back that I wasn't stressed about the final sprint. This race was my personal best, and the one where I had the most fun. I would do this race over and over again if I could, but I can't wait for states.

I wanted to send my regards to Wyatt, and Dylan, wishing up guys the best of luck in healing fast! Also I know River crashed, and had some problems throughout the race, and I have to say this is a huge bummer, because I know how hard he has been working, we ride together, and we decided that we would get podium after at Petaluma we were so close. I know for a fact that he would have had his best race!

Let's kick some butt at states!
