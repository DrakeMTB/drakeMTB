Non the less this race was interesting, exciting, and eye opening experience.  

Now, I'm not usually one to write these race reports, usually it's because I'm pretty whipped after races and fall asleep mid-way and forget to finish writing them (MY BAD) But I figured since  I only raced for about 6 minutes of the race I could bust it out and make this a first timer for this season. 

For starters,  thank you so much for all the support from family and friends on the team, even though most of you are basically family, for all of the adventures we have all had together riding. Also a big thanks to Trevor, just incase you didn't know the man is a miracle worker. As many of you know I have had back pain through many of the races and due to a recent crash I wasn't even sure if it was worth racing today, or if I should reserve  it for States. Thanks to him I was really able to loosen up and release pain, which mentally was a big step up. 

Being a previous gold medal-er on the course I can't lie but say I'm kinda a fan of all the killer uphill, flowy downhill and RACE CARS AND MOTORCYCLES that hall around the racetrack. 

Anyway back to the topic! So. The pre ride was just like any other, an easy spin around a well rain packed trail was a blast. Letting Jeffrey and Ronan, (AKA the chippy black hair one and the corky red head SOPHOMORE LEADER) lead was a good idea due to there great handling and easy to follow lines. I've been riding with these two fellas since the beginning of my riding time and always manage to have fun. After completing one lap we felt like we understood the course and with my back beginning to act up we called it a day. 

Waking up a 7 was a treat! Usually waking up at 6 I felt very well rested getting in that extra hour. I woke up to some Stevie Ray Vaughn and easily managed to leave the hotel on time. (A first for us!) Heading to the course I finally got hungry and ate a muffin and a banana, once arriving they were followed by a burrito and many sausages, plus Advil. 

I went over and checked in with Trevor and got primed up for racing. I did everything like I usually would even if I wasn't sure about racing just in case. My warmup felt surprising good and after that I knew I could back down or I'd be kicking my self until States. So there I went. After a talk with the Tam coaches (Thanks Sarah!) due to some interactions during the last race, the conversation on the starting like was pretty mediocre. But I didn't care, purely there to have fun and mess with awkward teenagers Walden and I sat and judged all the leaders bike. Many of them were very nice indeed but I was doing anything to keep my mind of racing and injury. After two, ten second countdowns we were off! Standing on the start line for 10 minutes doesn't help the warmup process is my legs but I figured I had a few time up Hurl hill to get that all sorted out. Falling back a few places off the bat was not mentally pleasing  but I knew I had to remain calm. Completing the starter loop was a flash and we began the descent. Dust was everywhere, I guess they never learned the art of using your front brake and managed to create quite the dust storm. Coming the first corner I back off the riders ahead of me to assure that I could see were the heck I was going. Now clearly that didn't work, they all decided to slow way down, in an attempt to pass I hung the corer hard, and needed the extra space to recover. That extra space was a pile of dead tree braces and launched me OTB, surprisingly far. As my body introduced its self to the ground I could tell I was immediately down for the count. After many attempts to get back up I finally noticed the gash on my knee and my inability to move it. 

So there I was, EMT on scene, with Charlie and a Tam coach as awesome back ups. After hearing that Dylan Harris also fell bad, we managed to keep the EMT's pretty booked up. With some bandaging and a 4X4 we finally managed to get up higher ground and off to the hospital. 

As I lay in this hospital bed I'm pretty bummed to be getting 34 stitches in my knee but happy that nothing is broken. (Wow did I learn how much I hate laughing gas, what a trip that was! A 15 minutes procedure felt like a life time.) Congrats to all those who really put it all out there today and brought this team to its victory. Wish I could be there to celebrate. A really quick shout out to Uma, Elise, Marya, Ronan, Dylan, Dean, Kyle, Otis, Logan, Gabe, Walden, Stella, and think you get the point of how amazing it is to be surrounded by such awesome riders and people. Happy Mothers Day!
