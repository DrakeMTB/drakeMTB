**Drake MTB Registration is Open** - deadline 10/15/15
Its that time of year when we need your help completing forms and getting set up for the season. You may recall, registration is a 2-step process. First, you register with Drake and then we forward your information to NorCal and they will invite you to register with the league and pay a league registration fee. 
 
**Step 1**. Click on the link to the Drake MTB Registration page and complete the Drake Parent Waiver

**Drake MTB Registration Link.** ( http://goo.gl/forms/6QBGiaPkpi ) We recommend you print and complete the form before you input the information. Its long and it will not save what you start. Please do not use all caps.

**Drake Parent Waiver Form.** (link to form) You must return this form to Jolie Jacobs by October 15th. If you have not turned in this form, you will not be able to participate in any team events. 

**Step 2.** The NorCal League will invite you to register (within the next 30 days)
