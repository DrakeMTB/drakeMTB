**A few details to note:**

* This is a new vendor. Previously we used Capo and now we are switching to Castelli. 
* EVERYONE needs a new jersey this year. The previous jersey will not suffice in the races but you are welcome to continue to wear it for training rides.  
* There are 2 versions of the jersey. The TEAM is the slimmer cut, race fit jersey, with raglan sleeves. The TRAINING is the fuller cut jersey with set-in sleeves. 
* L/S is short for Long Sleeve
* Castelli will ship to Coach Sarah and Coach Otis who will then distribute to the riders.
