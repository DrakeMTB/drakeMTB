##Sarah Starbird - Co-Head Coach
![sarah](../images/Sarah-Starbird.jpg)

A transplant to the Bay Area after graduation from Boston University, Sarah has been riding and creating great memories on the trails since discovering Marin in 1989.

She originally relocated to San Francisco to be, believe or not, a banker (booor-ring) but quickly learned about a very cool place to work where you were paid to ride your bike and travel as a bike guide – called Backroads. “It wasn’t quite as glamorous as it sounds, because it was grueling hard work, but it was a fantastic experience and one of great opportunities and amazing adventures.

Soon into her new career at Backroads, she began racing mountain and cyclo-cross bikes.  “From the time I was six, I have been racing or competing in one event or another; swimming, tennis, softball, crew, running and riding. I have a lot to be thankful for from my early and recent mentors I met during my competitive racing days. They were so supportive of my efforts and achievements.”  Sarah hopes to deliver the same act of kindness by being a mentor to the Drake riders and making a difference in their lives.

Now living on Woodacre with her 3 dogs and partner Chris, you can usually find Sarah riding the trails, often with the dogs running along side.

As of the 2013 season, Sarah becomes Co-Director of the team along with Jeff Broussard, taking the reins from Dan Freeman who helped found the team a decade prior.

##Otis Guy - Co-Head Coach

2013 marks Mountain Bike Hall Of Famer Otis Guy’s second season coaching for the Drake MTB Team.

Otis started riding mountain bikes in 1973 with Joe Breeze and Marc Vendetti. They first rode single speed pre-WWII Schwinns all over Mt. Tam. They later progressed to adding gears to old frames until Joe began building new frames in 1978.

Otis started building frames in 1982 under his own name.  He’s the only person to have raced the first Repack downhill mountain bike race (just outside Fairfax), the first Mountain Bike National Championships (1983), and the first Mountain Bike World Championships (1990). He holds the record for third fastest time ever on Repack, and won the event once. For 15 years he had his own race team (1985-2000). Otis was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1993.

Otis is also a Paramedic and worked for the Ross Valley Fire Service from 1975 to 2007. In the summer Otis runs the Otis Guy Mountain Bike camp for 7-13 year olds to help develop more high school mountain bikers.

His daughter Alexis graduated from Drake in 2001, and his oldest son Sterling is a Sophomore at Drake and on the Drake MTB team.  His youngest son Marcus is in 7th grade attending White Hill and is excited about joining the Drake team when he enters high school.

##Jeff Broussard – Asst. Coach

Jeff started with the Drake Mountain Bike Team for the 2011 season, coaching for two years before becoming a Co-Director/Asst. Coach for the 2013 season and Asst. Coach for 2014.

He works at Drake High School and is fortunate to be able to work and hang out with many of the riders on the team.  Jeff is passionate about working with youth and being part of the Drake MTB Team is an extension of that passion.

Growing up in Texas, Jeff had no experience riding on “mountains,” but when he did start riding at five years old he never stopped.  BMX was his primary hobby growing up and he even met Tinker Juarez as a young teenager when Tinker visited Jeff’s local track as a Pro on the Mongoose BMX team.  Jeff had success at BMX, but will never forget how Tinker schooled him and the rest of his team.

When he moved to the bay area in 1989 he discovered mountain biking and traded his car for his first mountain bike.  He literally traded his Subaru hatchback for the Specialized Rock Hopper straight up.  After moving to Marin in 1992, mountain biking became his favorite hobby and has ridden almost every trail on Mt. Tam since.  Jeff discovered his greatest passion in mountain biking when he visited Mammoth Mountain and rode his first true downhill A few years later, he would chase the legendary Johnny Tomac down the course that started his passion with mountain bikes, the Kamikaze.  He had a successful amateur career racing Cat 1 Downhill, Dual Slalom, and 4 cross at Mammoth, Big Bear, Northstar, Downieville and other great riding areas.  Despite racing motorcycles, triathlons, and open water swimming, mountain biking continued to be his core form of joy and exercise.

Jeff loves to share his passion for mountain bikes with the next generation of riders who will one day share their love for mountain bikes with their children on Mt. Tam.

As of the 2013 season, Jeff becomes Co-Director of the team along with Sarah Starbird, taking the reins from Dan Freeman who helped found the team a decade prior.

Eric Brandt began working with the Drake MTB team in 2005 when his son joined the team as a freshman. Over the years Eric continued to ride with the team, as a parent ride leader and coach.

He has been a mechanic at the races using the skills he gained over 20 years of working as a road race mechanic for Shimano, SRAM and Mavic.

Eric continues to enjoy the energy and enthusiasm of the high school bike racer and looks forward to oiling chains, adjusting derailleurs and getting dropped on climbs by teenagers each Sunday morning.

##Joe Breeze – Mechanic

Joe helps keep the teams gears running smoothly. He also happens to be one of the pioneers of mountain biking.

He was an early pioneer in the development of modern mountain bicycles, and is widely considered to be one of its inventors, along with other pioneers, including Tom Ritchey, Charlie Kelly, Charlie Cunningham, and Gary Fisher. He was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1988.

Today he continues to be a vocal advocate of cycling working with government agencies to make streets more bicycle-friendly as well as with grass-roots organizations to promote the bicycle as a practical mode of transportation.

We are very proud to have Joe onboard the Drake MTB Pirate’s ship.
