# Drake Captains

The Drake team captains provide on-the-trail and on-campus leadership for a team with an unparalleled record of consistency and excellence over the years.  Drake captains are chosen for their integrity and leadership, helping the coaches with mentoring and support for such a large and diverse racing team.  Perhaps most importantly, the captains are always available as resources for the other Riders on the Drake campus during school hours, something that coaches and parents cannot provide.  And if captains are willing, they are encouraged to share their phone numbers so other Riders can text them for help.  

## The following individuals are currently Captains for the Drake MTB team:

#### Marya Smith

My name is **Marya Smith** and I will be a Senior this year at Drake! This will be my second year as a varsity rider.

Growing up at the foot of Mt. Tam and Fairfax, I couldn’t wait to get my bike on the mountain from the second I took off the training wheels. Growing up just riding with my dad and then going to bike camps in the summer I was eager to start up on the team when I got to Drake. Even while being a little hesitant and nervous about the racing in the beginning, I decided why not be different and try something new! (Also the sport was in desperate need of some girl power).

Over the years I have grown to become a more skilled rider as well as develop a strong understanding of the team and our strengths and weaknesses as a whole.

As a captain, I strive to serve as a role model to younger riders (especially for the small number of girls on the team!) and help build a strong and supportive community that motivates and encourages riders to work hard at practice and races but also have lots and lots of fun!

Mountain biking is not only an awesome group of kids but an even better sport that encompasses both my love for the outdoors, being active, and chit chatting away with my friends! Biking will forever be a part of my life and I can't wait to see where it takes me! Go pirates!

#### Walden Reed

My name is **Walden Reed** and I am a Senior and Varsity Rider.
When I moved to California at the beginning of freshman year I wanted to become a mountain biker. I love airplanes and things that move fast... I really like going fast. Over the last 3 years of biking, I worked hard and became fast on a bike. I don't talk much, but I like helping others, so please reach out to me if you have any questions :)

**Drake Captains** also meet a stringent set of **requirements** above and beyond showing up to team practices and races:

**Passion and excitement for the team and the sport**  
Great captains are passionate captains.  The spirit of the team drives our success; captains are constant ambassadors for the team and the sport, so taking the time to talk to anyone about the team, mountain biking, trail advocacy, girls on bikes, etc, is important for the future of the team.  Captains also show excitement for team rides and team events; if the people Riders look up to are excited about going to pelo and yoga and races, then they are too.

**Knowing the rules**  
All captains are asked to read the NICA RuleBook so that they can help coaches and ride leaders with the task of keeping the whole team working within the specified league rules.  This is important for training rides and races; for example, a Rider who accepts mechanical assistance during a race can accrue a costly point penalty, and a Rider who rides illegal trails can be disqualified from racing.  

**Race reports**  
All Riders are encouraged to write race reports for each race that they participate in, so Captains are strongly encouraged to set a good example for the rest of the team.  Race reports help new riders understand every aspect of the racing experience – training, nutrition, strategy, competitors, and nervousness.  They are also fantastic tools for self-reflection for the writer of the report, and give parents and family a perspective on the racing experience that pictures or on-site viewing cannot provide.

**Ride leaders**  
Training rides give new riders ways to get to know their own physical limits in what are often new and difficult surroundings.  By having experienced and WFA+CPR certified student riders with every training ride, the coaches and ride leaders gain crucial depth for on-the-spot training, coaching, injury triage, and mechanical assistance.

**WFA and CPR certified**  
Captains are strongly encouraged to take the time to be certified in Wilderness First Aid and CPR training, so that they can set an example for other riders to be self-sufficient, helpful and safe trail riders, whether on a team ride or on a mid-summer out-of-state vacation.  There are opportunities in the fall and summer (off-season) for anyone affiliated with the Drake team to get trained in WFA and CPR; contact DrakeMTBCoaches@gmail.com for dates.

**Organize one team event per year**  
One of the most difficult aspects of building team cohesiveness is finding time outside of team practices to get together and just be kids.  Each captain makes an effort to schedule and organize one event that is outside of team practices to build togetherness, whether it be a Superbowl picnic, post-ride barbecue, or a movie night.  Parental supervision is mandatory, but the captains schedule and run the events, and can request team budget funding as needed.

**Captains and #DrakeMTBGirls**  
Getting more girls on the Drake team is a mission-critical initiative for many reasons.  Mountain biking is a gender-neutral activity, but the sport is still heavily skewed towards male.  When the composition of the team reflects the general demographics of Drake High School, then we can consider #DrakeMTBGirls a success, and shorten the hashtag to #DrakeMTB.  Until then, all of the captains have a responsibility to recruit, retain, and promote girls on the team so that girls see it as an activity that they own, vs one that is “boys only”.  Activities include appropriate social media postings (see example below), organizing rides with younger female riders, having girls-only rides at least once a month (in lieu of a regular Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday team ride), and having at least one girls-only Drake MTB social event.

**Example of an “appropriate social media posting”**

And finally, it is always good to check in with Title IX: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”

**Social media and #DrakeMTB**  

DrakeMTB is a powerful voice in the local social community and the global mountain biking community, and each captain shares responsibility to expand this voice.  Trail access is a critical local issue and projecting the positive aspects of mountain bike racing to those in our surrounding area is an important long-term goal for future #DrakeMTB riders.  See also ["the spirit of howdy"...](http://www.teentrailcorps.org/) There is a reason Howdy is so prominently displayed on our team kit. DrakeMTB exists because of the the [NICA](http://www.nationalmtb.org/) and [Norcal](http://www.norcalmtb.org/)  mission of “strong body, mind and character through the sport of cycling”, and Drake captains all share some responsibility for promoting these values in the greater social media community.

**Pre-race talks**  
Each team captain can volunteer for pre-race talks to get the other riders ready to race.  While adults can give guidance and suggestions for racing, over the years we have found that peers speaking about the pressures and strategy of racing can be more effective, though a rousing Roll Pirates! cheer is something that we encourage everyone in the Pit Zone to participate in.

**Yoga Captain**  
Drake riders train hard before and during the season, and such strenuous training can lead to muscle development that needs complementary exercise for long-term health and physical balance.  Thanks to one of our sponsors, <http://www.marinpoweryoga.com>, the team has an opportunity to engage in stretching-focused yoga.  One of the Drake captains has responsibility for getting those who want or need weekly Yoga involved with these free weekly sessions.

**Pelo Captain**  
Interval training is one of the keys to improving race performance, and we have yet another sponsor <http://www.pelofitness.com>  who offers free weekly sessions for the Drake team.  Because trail terrain varies and riders tend to spread out over time, true interval training is very difficult.  Pelo training gets all of the riders in one room and helps them do true power-based cycling interval training and visualization.  There is a very strong correlation between fitness improvement and Pelo attendance – ask any past rider.  One of the Drake captains has responsibility for getting those who want or need weekly interval training involved with these free weekly sessions.
