<h2>An Announcement from our League - NorCal</h2>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;">We are excited to "officially" let you know that your teams will get to ride in our 2021 spring season...woohoo! Teams will at the very least get to practice, ride and have fun together, and hopefully we will be able to offer some in person events as well. Currently the State of California is allowing youth recreation programs to go ahead in cohorts of a maximum of 14 kids, and 2 coaches, for a total of 16 people, but is not allowing large gatherings. We recommend you break your cohort groups down to 12 kids and 2 coaches, to meet our recommended 1:6 ratio for coaches to kids.</p>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;">Team and student-athlete registration-in the <a href="https://pitzone.nationalmtb.org/users/sign_in" target="_blank">Pit Zone</a>-for the spring 2021 season will open on October 1st, so that y'all can be ready for the start of the pre-season as early as October 15. All coaches and student-athletes must be "practice ready" before they may participate in team activities.</p>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;">We are still in a holding pattern as far as what our race season will look like in 2021, but below are the three concrete scenarios we are planning for:</p>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;"><strong>Plan A</strong>: Teams may host outdoor mountain bike practices and core and strength conditioning outside. The NorCal League will not host it's traditional 5-race series, but instead will offer a season of progressive virtual challenges for individuals and teams to get stoked on competition.</p>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;"><strong>Plan B</strong>: Teams may host outdoor mountain bike practices and core and strength conditioning outside. The NorCal League will host small regional races [in time trial format] and teams will be assigned blocks of time during the race weekend to arrive, warm up, race, and depart. *We are working hard with our venue partners to set our venues up to accommodate social distancing. Traditional individual and team awards will be awarded, just not in person.</p>
<p style="width:90%; text-align:left; padding-left:12%;"><strong>Plan C</strong>: The State of CA, and local government, determine that we can host large gatherings again, and we are able to host a 5-race series, as we always have!</p>

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>It was a spring day in 2002, when a Drake High sophomore and Drake teacher found themselves competing against
  each other unexpectedly at a race infamously known as Billy Cross. It was a classic match-up of student versus
  master every bit as great as Vader vs. Kenobi. They fought, struggled, and even trash-talked to gain cycling
  supremacy at Drake High, the only high school in the country to produce not one but two national collegiate
  cycling champions. The stakes were high and what happened on that day is the stuff of legend. Some will say
  that the kid showed up the master by beating him to the line. Others deny, saying the kid only had to do two laps,
  and the old timer, three. Not a fair comparison, perhaps.</p>
