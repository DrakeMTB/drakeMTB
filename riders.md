[Know what to wear on a ride for any weather condition]({{site.baseurl}}/images/what_to_wear_v2.pdf)

**Why we ride**  
We ride because we love spending five to ten hours a week on a bike, hanging out with friends, and competing against other racers.  We love pushing the limits of our endurance out in some of the best scenery on the planet, and we understand that part of our attraction to the sport comes from it being more physically dangerous and challenging than sitting in front of a video game.

**What we race**  
We race in a category of mountain biking called cross-country.  From Wikipedia:  

*“Cross-country cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails. Riding or racing is also only deemed cross-country if the technical complexity of the trails is easy or moderate. Trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed "all-mountain", "freeride", or "downhill".*

If you only live for extreme riding, consider dropper posts as a must-have for the trails you ride, and get bored easily riding fire roads, then this may not be the sport for you.  Our training rides focus on building leg strength, lung strength, and enough technical skills for the cross-country courses that we race on.  If you show up expecting Downhill or Enduro rides every day, then the coaches will be happy to refer you to trails you can ride as an independent rider.

**What we expect**  
**Follow the rules below, and understand that riding as a team is a privilege, not a right.** Riding as a team requires safe riders, engaged parents, dedicated coaches and ride leaders, and coordination with the community of people who manage and use the same trails that we ride.  In return, you, as a team rider, are expected to adhere to the rules below; failure to know and follow these rules will result in losing your privilege to ride and race with the team.  If the rules are ignored repeatedly by multiple riders, then it puts the entire team (and trail access for all riders) at risk.  Riding as a team is a privilege, not a right, and we maintain that privilege, day after day, by working with the coaches, ride leaders, parents, and local community to follow the rules set out below.

**Rules for Riders**   
These rules exist solely to help keep our right to ride as a team.  You as an individual rider can hop on a bike and ride anytime and anywhere you choose, but that is not the point of riding with a team.  You ride with a team so that you can regularly ride with a group of friends, improve your skills, learn from more experienced riders, ride new trails and routes, help less experienced riders get stronger, and enjoy the thrill and nervous excitement of racing in as safe an environment as can be expected.  The coaches, ride leaders, and parents give you this privilege on the condition that you make a personal commitment to follow the rules below:

 1. **Always wear a helmet**  
No one wants to be sitting around for a month waiting for a concussion to clear up, let alone having someone spoon-feed you for the rest of your life.  Even if you are the brother of a competitor sitting on a bike in the parking lot before a race, you must have a helmet on at all times.  This rule applies to Coaches/Parents/Guardians/anyone associated with the team as well. Additionally, riders at league races caught without helmets, except on trainers, will be docked 25 points and/or disqualified from a race.

 2. **Avoid Illegal trails**  
We ride the trails that are legal, no exceptions.  Marin County is blessed with open space, fire roads, singletrack, and hiking trails in an abundance that most other places can only dream of... we are allowed access to the trails we ride only because of the hard work that others have already put into bike trail advocacy.  If you want more singletrack trails to ride, work with the coaches and parents to get involved with a trails advocacy group.  Riding illegal trails because they suit your personal taste better puts ALL local mountain biking at risk.  Riders caught riding illegal trails will immediately lose team riding privileges.

 3. **Show up for two team rides a week**  
Each rider must ride at least two of the four team rides each week.  Coaches take roll before each team ride, and those who are not going to at least two rides per week will lose racing privileges.

 4. **Ride safely and stay with your ride group when on team rides**  
Mountain biking is a dangerous sport, and riders are exposed to situations and elements that are difficult to control. The best way to minimize danger is to ride within your limits and stay with your ride group.  If something bad does happen, you can get immediate assistance from ride leaders and team mates for first aid, mechanical breakdowns, and perhaps food and water.  Some rides take us hours away from home, out in the wilderness, and safety demands that we ride within our skills and as a group.  Riders that purposefully leave their ride group without checking in with adult Ride Leaders or Coaches during the ride will lose their privilege to ride and race with the team.  Riders who regularly ride beyond their skills and encourage others to do the same will also lose their privilege to ride with the team.  Leaving a ride early to make it to jazz band practice is fine, just make sure that you let an adult Ride Leader or Coach know BEFORE you leave the group so that we are not looking for a mangled bike and unconscious rider off of a Tamarancho cliffside in near-darkness.

 5. **Avoid trick riding on team rides**  
Jumping off ramps, extended wheelies while riding in a crowd, curling berms and other free-ride dangerous maneuvers during team-sponsored rides puts the whole team at risk, not just the Rider.  

 6. **Treat each other with respect on and off the bike**  
There should be nothing but support between all riders regardless of skill level or gender. Negative comments about team members will not be tolerated.

 7. **Show trail courtesy – be the Spirit of Howdy!! (See <http://www.spiritofhowdy.org> for more information)**  
When riding on Public Lands please keep the following in mind:

    * Always yield right of way to other users
    * Respect other trail user groups
    * Control your speed
    * Do not litter
    * **Say Howdy to all users!!!**
 8. **Communicate with your parents, Ride Leaders, and Coaches**  
Communicate with your parents, Ride Leaders, and Coaches when you are not feeling yourself physically or mentally – generally the adults around you are not good at reading minds, and over-communication is better than guesswork.  Let them know how they can help you, when you need it!

 9. **Read your Drake MTB email and texts**  
Emails and/or texts are the most effective way for us to reach all of you with last-minute information concerning everything from events to race day logistics. Sudden changes in schedules and team activities are inevitable, so please stay informed.  [Join the Drake MTB Google group](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCDynLJepyBTFAzqfZI9dTpCWTGCgzkQdhY0TSY6LIkXKXKg/viewform), and make sure you are receiving the posts.

 10. **Participate in team fundraisers**  
Our team is fully self-supporting and it takes everyone participating to make it successful.  Please participate in all team fundraisers. If you choose to not participate, you can pay an “Opt-out” fee instead.

 11.  **Participate in trail maintenance at least once during the season**  
The trails we ride only exist because of the efforts of folks that have built them, sustained them, and advocated for them, probably before you were born.  Drake MTB respects that tradition and expects every rider to participate in at least one trail maintenance volunteer activity during the school year.
 12. **Volunteer for local groups and events**  
Drake MTB is an important part of the local community, and our voice and numbers carry weight in the communities where we live.  Whether being active with [MCBC](http://www.marinbike.org/), going to meetings on Marin open-space usage, or getting information out to the team on which local politicians support the team’s trail access agenda, each Rider and family member can have lasting local impact.
 13. **Familiarize yourself with NICA rulebook**  
The [NICA rulebook](http://www.nationalmtb.org/wp-content/uploads/NICA-Rulebook.pdf) contains a great deal of information, and reading it helps parents and Riders understand the need for some of the team rules above, how the races are run and scored, and a host of other rules and regulations that are helping high-school mountain biking grow into a mainstream sport: http://www.nationalmtb.org/wp-content/uploads/NICA-Rulebook.pdf
 14. **Have FUN!**  
Mountain biking is one of the best sports there is. It is excellent low-impact aerobic exercise that you can do for a lifetime. You can cover more ground and see more cool stuff than with any other sport – at least that is the belief of the team!

**We are a PEANUT-FREE TEAM, so no foods with peanut ingredients or peanut-flavor energy bars. Please check ingredients of the foods you are bringing.**
