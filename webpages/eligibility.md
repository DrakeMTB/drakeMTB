# Drake MTB Eligibility Requirements

The Drake mountain bike team allows any high school rider who is willing to make the time and effort to learn the sport of mountain biking and participate in races join the team, with the following requirements.

If you decide to join the team, you as a rider commit to the following:


 * Attend 2 practices per week (not including Yoga) and 3 of 6 races.

 * Participate in The Drake MTB hill climb (run as a pre season and postseason event).  This is an activity used to determine your physical ability, and you must complete [this ride](https://www.strava.com/routes/4969427) in 25 minutes or less.  If you are new to the sport, we strongly recommend trying this route and checking your fitness level prior to your commitment to team participation.

 * Be self-sufficient with your equipment and on the trails.  Mountain biking is a dangerous sport, and riders are exposed to situations and elements that are difficult to control.  The team has limited financial and coaching resources and may not have the ability to properly and safely monitor riders that require one-on-one supervision.

 * If you are not comfortable with the requirements above, contact <DrakeMTBCoaches@gmail.com>.  The Drake team will consult with your parent(s) or guardian(s) to come up with a workable plan for your participation on the team, but participation is not guaranteed.
