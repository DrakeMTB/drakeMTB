Being a mountain bike parent can be an amazing way to connect with other parents and Riders on the team. Our goal is to help families and Riders have the most rewarding Drake MTB experience by providing a way for parents and guardians to spend more time with their Riders before they move on to life beyond high school. We have generally found that the more Riders and families participate in activities together, the more satisfying the mountain bike team experience. For questions that we do not address below, please contact <DrakeMTBParents@gmail.com>.

The Drake Mountain Bike Team is a club sport, which means that the team cannot function without volunteer labor and support, most of which comes from you, the Parents.  Please review the following mandatory parent/guardian responsibilities:

* Take care of Mandatory Drake MTB forms and fees (see links and deadlines above)
* Assure that your Rider meets the [Eligibility requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/eligibility)
* Review and understand [Team and Norcal League Rules]({{site.baseurl}}/rules)
* Make sure that you and your Rider understand the ins and outs of [team training rides]({{site.baseurl}}/practices).  
* Make sure that your Rider wears [the proper clothing on training rides]({{site.baseurl}}/images/what_to_wear_v2.pdf) and attends each ride with the [proper equipment]({{site.baseurl}}/images/what_to_bring.jpg)

**Volunteer Parental Activities**
If you got through the checklist of forms above by the required deadlines, congratulations! Drake MTB has a [culture of parent involvement]({{site.baseurl}}/volunteer) both at races and during the season between races. There are many ways to help, and many skills needed. At least one parent is expected to attend races with their Rider, and pitch in to help during race day. Without parent volunteers, the team activities and races would literally grind to a dusty halt.

**Volunteer at the Races**
Drake MTB prides itself on having the best Pit Zone in the State (that’s the place where everyone hangs out). We provide food, bike racks, warm-up trainers, recovery drinks, shade, seating and technical mechanical assistance throughout the entire day. This is a group effort that requires major help from parents to keep our team healthy, prepared and race ready. Please look at the Volunteers page to get an idea of how the volunteer efforts are organized; more than a decade of hard work, wisdom and practice has gone into figuring out how to run the league’s best Pit Zone with volunteer labor, so your time and efforts are in good hands!

**Volunteer for Norcal while at the races**
NorCal also needs parents for course set-up and takedown, parking coordination, course marshals, registration, scoring, sweepers, etc. There is plenty of opportunity to stay busy and work off that nervous energy! Let’s continue to show that Drake always helps out at all times.

**Attend Parent Committee meetings and get involved**<a name="committees"></a>
Parent Committee meetings are scheduled for the 1st Tuesday of each Month in the Drake Student Center or Devonshire Hall (check team calendar if unsure of date or location) at 7pm. If there is no school on the first Tuesday of the month, then the meeting is usually rescheduled for the next Tuesday school is in session. If you miss a meeting, check out [agendas/notes]({{site.baseurl}}/meetings) from previous meetings. The purpose of the meetings is to create an opportunity to share news about upcoming events, help plan for those events and get involved to help support team activities. All are welcome and encouraged to attend. We try to limit the meetings to one hour but you often see parents sticking around for a while after catching up with one another. Drake Mountain biking has been a powerhouse in cycling for the past 15 years because of our parents. We are well organized, enthusiastic, friendly and involved. We need a village to operate the club with fundraising, parties, and the races (food, feed zones, cheering, [video clips]({{site.baseurl}}/media), etc). Please come!

**Ride with the team on Sundays**
Parents are invited to ride with the team on Sunday rides if they so choose.  We ask that such parents meet the same [physical requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/eligibility), [bike-ready requirements from the FAQs]({{site.baseurl}}/faq.md), [trail-ready gear]({{site.baseurl}}/images/what_to_bring.jpg) , and [wear-the-right-stuff requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/images/what_to_wear_v2.pdf) as the Riders.  In doing so, parents have the opportunity to spend time with their Rider while assisting Coaches and Ride Leaders with [managing team rides]({{site.baseurl}}/practices).  Please reach out to <DrakeMTBCoaches@gmail.com> if you have any questions.

We are a **PEANUT-FREE TEAM**, so no foods with peanut ingredients or peanut-flavor energy bars. Please check ingredients of the foods you are bringing.
