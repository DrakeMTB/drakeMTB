**Pelo Rules for 2020/2021**  
* Make sure you have set up a Pelo account here [first](https://www.pelofitness.com/firstride); you only need to do this once at the beginning of the season.
* [<strong>SIGN UP WITH PELO USERNAME HERE</STRONG>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dFe4KOD_Rx3vlWvJLmuRftxnuOvZliAjoSk6S6Ckg9g/edit#gid=1463035279)
* Sign-ups are first-come, first-served... if you can't spell your Pelo Username properly, we cannot reserve your bike
* <b>If you sign up and are not on a bike by 5 after the hour, you still have to pay for the session AND you will forfeit your bike to someone else (ie, if you sign up, SHOW UP). </b>
* <b>The first time you sign up and do not show up, you will get a warning; the second time, you will lose your Drake Pelo privileges for the season.  If an emergency occurs and you cannot make a session you signed up for, you must notify Kim Janson-Smith via text at 415-690-9009 BEFORE that session begins. </b>
* Pelo sessions cost $8 per Rider per session; Drake MTB will contact your parents for payment for all of your Pelo sessions prior to the last race
* <b>Sign up opens up on Sunday at noon and closes down by 10pm Monday night.</b>  The Monday night cut-off helps us get more seats in the 4 o'clock class.  If you are not sure you can commit to a Pelo class this far in advance, then go to the 5 o'clock class which always has open seats.
* We will strive to have 25 seats for Drake riders in the 4pm slot but there are no guarantees since the available slots depend on when and how many slots other schools take.  If you sign up for 4pm and do NOT get a bike reserved, we will let you know.   5pm slot will have 10 bikes for Drake, and there are usually 10 open seats for any late-comers.
* Honor system - no deleting other names, give other Riders the chance to do Pelo (ie, we only have 35 spots in total, so not all Riders can or should do every Pelo session)
* Don't forget to bring SPD bike shoes, kit, water bottle, and maybe a towel+change of clothes
* Need a ride?  try using the list to form your own carpools!
* IF you still want to do Pelo but these time slots are booked or do not work for your crazy high school schedule, then you can always book a regular class at the student rate of $23 per session

**Why we ride**  
We ride because we love spending five to ten hours a week on a bike, hanging out with friends, and competing against other racers.  We love pushing the limits of our endurance out in some of the best scenery on the planet, and we understand that part of our attraction to the sport comes from it being more physically dangerous and challenging than sitting in front of a video game.

**What we race**  
We race in a category of mountain biking called cross-country.  From Wikipedia:  

*â€œCross-country cycling is defined by the terrain on which it is performed. XC courses and trails consist of a mix of rough forest paths and singletrack (also referred to as doubletrack depending on width), smooth fireroads, and even paved paths connecting other trails. Riding or racing is also only deemed cross-country if the technical complexity of the trails is easy or moderate. Trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed "all-mountain", "freeride", or "downhill".*

If you only live for extreme riding, consider dropper posts as a must-have for the trails you ride, and get bored easily riding fire roads, then this may not be the sport for you.  Our training rides focus on building leg strength, lung strength, and enough technical skills for the cross-country courses that we race on.  If you show up expecting Downhill or Enduro rides every day, then the coaches will be happy to refer you to trails you can ride as an independent rider.

**What we expect**  
**Follow the [rules]({{site.baseurl}}/rules) and understand that riding as a team is a privilege, not a right.** Riding as a team requires safe riders, engaged parents, dedicated coaches and ride leaders, and coordination with the community of people who manage and use the same trails that we ride.  In return, you, as a team rider, are expected to adhere to the rules below; failure to know and follow these rules will result in losing your privilege to ride and race with the team.  If the rules are ignored repeatedly by multiple riders, then it puts the entire team (and trail access for all riders) at risk.  Riding as a team is a privilege, not a right, and we maintain that privilege, day after day, by working with the coaches, ride leaders, parents, and local community to follow the [rules]({{site.baseurl}}/rules).


**We are a PEANUT-FREE TEAM, so no foods with peanut ingredients or peanut-flavor energy bars. Please check ingredients of the foods you are bringing.**
