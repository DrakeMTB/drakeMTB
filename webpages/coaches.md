# Drake Head Coaches, Assistant Coaches, Ride Leaders and Mechanics

![pic of 2019 Coaches and Ride Leaders]({{site.baseurl}}/images/drake_mtb_coaches_2019.jpg)

In recent years, Drake has had more than seventy Riders on the team.  Keeping such a large and diverse group of kids engaged across a variety of events, team rides, races, and volunteer engagements takes a dedicated team of experienced adults.  This team of experienced and qualified adults are selected based on their being good role models, motivators, teachers, organizers, authority figures, risk managers, and perhaps most importantly friends and mentors.  And they all have a love of the sport.  In addition, all coaches and ride leaders have a responsibility to maintain a safe and harassment- and discrimination-free environment at all team events and rides, and are also expected to:

 * Keep safety top of mind in all team rides and events
 * Behave professionally
 * Use appropriate language
 * Model good sporting behavior
 * Model being respectful of others and of our environment
 * Be energized and upbeat
 * Cheer the team
 * Give specific feedback and praise
 * Celebrate effort and victories
 * Respect the land management rules whether with the team or not

**Three Co-Head Coaches**  
The co-head coaches are involved with every aspect of the team, but have primary responsibility for the following:

 * Set up the ride calendar for the season
 * Select ride leaders and assistant coaches
 * Make sure every team ride has adequate coaching staff and ride leaders
 * Coordinate guest speakers and team volunteer engagements
 * Attend parent committee meetings
 * Work with [Norcal](http://www.norcalmtb.org/) on race scheduling and race-day logistics
 * Organize team workouts at sponsors [Pelo](https://www.pelofitness.com/) and [Marin Power Yoga](http://marinpoweryoga.com/)

**Ten Assistant Coaches**  
Like the head coaches, assistant coaches tend to be involved with every aspect of the team.  They are most important, however, in helping the head coaches with the following:

* Staffing every team ride and providing on-the-trail leadership for safety and risk management
 * Giving individual attention to Riders on team rides, helping them with technique, maintenance, encouragement, and feedback.
 * Acting as Pit Zone managers during races, making sure that each group of Riders knows their schedule for the day and follows it.  This includes critical things like making sure the kids are at the Pit Zone on time, have the proper equipment for racing, have access to a trainer before races, eat properly, have a race plate, don’t fall asleep in a car before a race, have had their bike checked out by the mechanics, eat after a race, cheer for the team, etc etc.

**Twenty Ride Leaders**  
As the name suggests, Ride Leaders are strong adult mountain bikers who work with the coaches to make sure that team rides are safe, organized, challenging, and fun.  Each group of riders that goes on a team ride has at least one Ride Leader at the front and one Ride Leader at the back (aka “Sweep”) so that no riders within a specific group are without immediate assistance in the event of injury or confusion as to ride route.  All Ride Leaders have been trained in Wilderness First Aid, CPR, and concussion identification.  At the end of every team ride, Ride Leaders let the head coaches know that all riders have completed the ride and made it back home (or to Deer Park) safely.


**Team Mechanic(s) in the Pit Zone during races**  
Mountain bikes are complex mechanical devices with many points of failure.  Riders put in long hours of training to prepare for races, and mechanical failures can put their personal safety at risk.  One of the best ways to minimize this risk is to train your Rider to know his her bike inside and out; as a back-up to that, the Drake team is extremely fortunate to have three team mechanics that check every single Rider’s bike in detail just before every race.  In the pre-race Pit Zone, the Drake team has seen last-minute drivetrain replacements, wheel swaps, brake change-outs, shock servicing, and a host of other complex issues addressed under great time pressure to keep the Riders ready to race.  The Mechanic’s Area of the Pit Zone is an amazing place, and staffed by bike mechanics with more than 60 years of wrenching… and more than 100 years of very entertaining bicycling-related stories.  Please encourage your Rider to treat them with the highest level of gratitude – they, too, are adult volunteers and do their jobs for altruistic reasons, and a single fussy or impatient rider who does not know his or her bike can wipe the smile off of a Mechanic’s face.

## Your Coaches, General Volunteer Ride Leaders, and Team Mechanics for the 2020-2021 Season

#### Co-Head Coach Chris Nelson

![chris_nelson]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chris_nelson.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Chris Nelson has been a competitive and recreational cyclist for over 35 years. He raced on the road at UC Berkeley and took up mountain biking in the mid 1980s. Mainly a lover of road cycling, Chris has recently fallen back in love with the dirt, especially since becoming a sponsor, parent volunteer and now Head Coach at Drake. He rides weekly with his other two head coaches and can often be found riding his MTB or road bike on many of the awesome trails and roads throughout Marin County. He played lacrosse growing up (and was coached by his father) but took up cycling while at Cal and hasn’t looked back. He is honored and excited to be helping out this amazing program of awesome student riders, parents and coaches and he’s especially proud to be following in his father’s footsteps of being a youth sports coach. He lives in San Anselmo and works in the residential real estate business. His son Liam races on the team.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Co-Head Coach Dylan Riley

![dylan_riley]({{site.baseurl}}/images/dylan.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

If traveling any sort of distance, Dylan Riley prefers to get there on two wheels whether it be by road bike, cross bike, cargo bike, tandem, e-bike, or mountain bike (mountain bike races excluded).  A former safe routes to school coordinator in San Francisco, Dylan has been involved with getting kids on bikes for years.  He is a builder of wheels, some of which are even round, a participant in races, usually not for last, and a father of two.  A veteran elementary school teacher of 13 years, he enjoys challenging kids to be their best and in the process is just happy to be along for the ride.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Co-Head Coach Shawn Nelson

![shawn]({{site.baseurl}}/images/shawn-coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Shawn Nelson has been a ride leader and Shwag guy now for 3 years and after countless rides has stepped up to be an assistant coach. He grew up in Marin and has been riding these trails for a lot of years. Shawn is slow but only because he's fat and old. If you are looking for someone to ride next to who will make you feel better about your riding skills he's the guy. Fortunately, his one story always seems fresh, and his purple bike makes him easy to spot when he has accidentally rolled down a hill during a water break. If you see him during a ride say Howdy and possibly help him back up to the trail if needed.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Bill Melton

![bill]({{site.baseurl}}/images/billm-coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

I bought my first mountain bike after I moved to San Francisco in 1990 for post-graduate education.  I started off biking every dirt path I could find in Golden Gate Park and then eventually ventured across the bridge to explore Marin's incredible terrain.  Several years later I moved to New Mexico and my mountain biking world opened up wide as the Southwest became my playground.  Eventually I found my way back to the Bay Area and have lived in Fairfax for the last 16 years and never tire of rolling on two wheels.  I have coached youth soccer for 9 years and am continually impressed with the ability of youth sports to challenge kids in ways that promote self-esteem and resilience.  Mountain bike racing and the Drake MTB team set the standard in this respect.  The commitment of the riders, coaches and parents is truly impressive and something I am excited to be a part of.  I really enjoyed riding with the team last year as a ride leader and look forward to serving as an assistant coach.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Chris Kenton

![chris-k]({{site.baseurl}}/images/kenton-coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

I'm Chris Kenton... I grew up in Sunnyvale, riding BMX bikes in the golden age of anodized alloy. Linda and I moved to Cascade in autumn of 1999, just in time to see the annual Appetite Seminar parade down our street. I was out raking leaves before our Thanksgiving guests arrived, watching hundreds of mountain bikers stream past. The next day I bought my first mountain bike to find out what I was missing and never looked back. I've learned more about myself from mountain biking than almost any other pursuit. The mental, physical and technical challenges never get old—and neither do the rewards of fresh air, adrenaline and alpine views. Unlike a lot of sports that you have to put on a shelf sooner or later, mountain biking is a life-long ride. I couldn't be happier sharing it with such a dedicated and passionate group of people.  

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Chris Miller

![chris]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chrism-coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Growing up in the Sierra, or growing older anyway, we didn’t realize we were mountain biking. We were just biking.... in the mountains. I can’t remember spending much time inside. Four seasons a year we were in the elements with our crew and it got ugly. Our poor parents, remember that, let us ride wild. When I moved to santa Cruz in the 90’s and found clipless pedals I fell in love. When I moved to Marin and began exploring trails I kept wondering how many people knew about these... Little did I know. I co-started the cross country and track team at manor school while coaching little league and girls softball, but in my mind there is no coaching like mountain bike coaching with these amazing drake athletes. 

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Jeff Guild

![jeff]({{site.baseurl}}/images/jeff-coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Howdy gang!  I’m Coach Jeff and I like mountain biking mostly because it’s fun, but also because it attracts cool people to hang out with. It’s also good for getting exercise and exploring places near and far. Besides all the fun, I really appreciate the opportunity biking gives me to challenge myself to improve skills and fitness, which in the end makes biking even more fun! Coaching on the Drake team gives me the opportunity to hang out with great people, support our student athletes in improving their skills and overcoming challenges, and generally share the stoke that comes from mountain biking.
Roll Pirates!

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<!--- #### Assistant Coach Lynn Valdivia ![lynn]({{site.baseurl}}/images/lynn-coach.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"} Lynn has been the team director the last three years and is taking a vacation from that to be another valued asset to the Drake team as an assistant coach.  It means she gets to ride a lot more, and worry about forms and deadlines a lot less.  Lynn is an incredibly strong rider, and if you ever want to watch the sunrise on the golden gate bridge, hop on the commute (bike) train that leaves Imagination Park at 5:50am just about every weekday morning rain or shine. <div style="clear: both;"></div> --->
  
#### Assistant Coach Karl Vavrek

![karl vavrek]({{site.baseurl}}/images/karl_coach.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Karl takes his bike everywhere.  But, all too often it just goes for a ride on the roof of his car (see pic).  Nonetheless, he rides as much as he can and is excited to be a ride leader for DrakeMTB for the first time this season.  He has some experience "Leading from Behind.”  While living in San Francisco (before he and his family moved to their first home on Porteous near our Deer Park trailhead), he was the Group Rides Coordinator for the Bicycle Trails Council of the East Bay for a couple years leading multi-club rides with Marin’s own WOMBATS. He loves trail work and he has raced, but only just to verify he was not meant to race competitively (and to say he went on a group ride with 299 other guys and finished before 150 of them… Ha!). But for an old guy, he does OK.  He’s Max’s dad and does architecture when not on his bike (or under it… inside his car, Moby).

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Mitch Brown

![mitch]({{site.baseurl}}/images/mitch-coach.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Mitch Brown is in his twelfth year of teaching at Manor School in Fairfax. He has been an elementary school teacher for thirteen years, and is the proud father of a son and daughter. Prior to elementary teaching, Mitch was a collegiate coach and teacher, two-time NCAA All American runner, and a graduate student of kinesiology (emphasis in teaching and coaching), where he completed all of his MA coursework (ABT). He is a two-time inductee into Humboldt State's Athletic Hall of Fame. He has been a lifelong road, mountain and BMX rider, and currently rides with Divine Electric, racing whenever he can. Mitch loves teaching kids and having fun playing Capture the Flag, Kingo, and other games. His earliest biking memory is of riding his yellow Schwinn Stingray up and down his street while singing the Happy Days theme song for hours on end. He is Wilderness First Aid & CPR Certified.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Matt Willis

![matt]({{site.baseurl}}/images/matt-coach.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Matt Willis is a man of many talents... father, doctor, engaging riding companion, and [man who used to race against Soviets on a bicycle during the Cold War years](http://articles.mcall.com/1988-05-29/sports/2628327_1_soviets-lap-four-riders).  Quick with a smile and encouragement, Matt is a very welcome addition to the Drake MTB coaching staff.

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Assistant Coach Ted Fehlhaber

![ted]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ted-coach.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"}

Ted Fehlhaber got his first mountain bike so he could explore Marin in 1999 and has not stopped.  Over the years, he has volunteered for Safe Routes to School, MCBC, Access for Bikes and Friends of Tamarancho. "The more young people we can get riding and enjoying the outdoors, the better.  Its a great life skill, and fun too.”

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

#### Ride Leader and General Volunteer Charlie Simpson ![charlie simpson]({{site.baseurl}}/images/charlie.JPG){:style="float: left;margin-right: 12px;margin-bottom: 12px;"} Charlie grew up in Colorado climbing 14,000’ peaks and rock climbing. His passion became alpine ski racing, which he did through college. Charlie has been mountain biking for about 20 years. His Drake coaching career started in 2013 and his primary goal is to have fun. He is also one of the team photographers on race day; so don’t forget to smile when you see him. <div style="clear: both;"></div>
