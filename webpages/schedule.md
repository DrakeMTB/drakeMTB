Lodging Info:

Due to the size of the team this year, we will need to split hotels, which usually happened last year anyway for various reasons.
Please contact the hotel directly to make your reservation on your credit card number.   We have secured group rates at each.
Please be sure and tell them you are with the Drake MTB Team to benefit from the rate offered below.
