##  50% Girls by 2025

The Drake Mountain Bike Team has made a public commitment to have half of the team represented by girl riders by 2025 (currently the team is approximately 33% girls).  

### Why do we care?  It is just a number...

Yes it is an abstract thing, this 50%, but it represents an ambitious goal to change the culture of cross-country mountain bike racing.  The Drake MTB team is a member of [NorCal](http://norcalmtb.org), which is a league within the National Interscholastic Cycling League, or [NICA](http://www.nationalmtb.org/).  The mission of these organizations is, simply, to get more kids on bikes by providing a "positive experience for all student-athletes, and helping them to create strong body, mind and character through the sport of cycling".  Last time we checked, approximately half of the student body at Drake is girls, so the 50% goal seems logical for appropriate representation of who attends Drake.  

But why do we care about changing the culture through public statement of this goal?  Drake Coach Laura Childress has been bicycling for a long time and has seen the sport evolve and change, but the ratio of women to men has remained frustratingly low.  Drake Coach Rob Reed has worked in the engineering and technical field for more than 20 years, and has seen similarly poor ratios in the Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) fields persist.  If we as a community do not work together to get adequate representation of gender in the fields of endeavor that we choose, then the culture of that field tends to be dominated by ideas, implementations, products, etc, that favor one gender or point of view over another.  The mission of NorCal and NICA is to get more kids on bikes and develop their mind and character through cycling... if we can, through Drake MTB, teach our Riders that there is no one way to ride to achieve success in later life, then we have taken one small but significant step towards changing the culture of cross-country mountain bike racing.  Mental strength, emotional strength, community strength, and physical strength all play important roles in bicycle racing, and we believe that working towards an even balance of gender ratios will help all Riders develop the multiple strengths needed not only for racing but for life beyond high school.

Don't take our word for it though... take a look at this video from our [third race in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N8iXa_M5oE).  Mental strength, emotional strength, community strength, physical strength - its all there.

Also take a look at this [great NorCal produced video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RMzVFlOF8R4) on the impact of mountain biking on girls. More information can be found in [this article](https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/story/the_new_normal).

The first time I ever rode a mountain bike was during the first team ride of my season, freshman year. Immediately, I knew this would be the sport I would stay with throughout high school and beyond. The people I met, the friends I made, the community that surrounded me was full of supportive, encouraging, fun people! Everyone on the team is there for each other. One of my favorite parts of the races is to walk the course with some team members, cheering for those currently racing. As part of the team, I learned how to push myself in ways I hadn’t before, every pedal stroke making me stronger, and the feeling of reaching the top of the mountain was one of the best I’ve ever felt! I love being able to be outdoors with this sport, exploring new territory and improving skills on the bike, both up and downhill. Joining the Drake Mountain Bike Team was one of the best decisions I’ve made. Nothing feels better than feeling the success of a ride or a race when surrounded by an entire community lifting you up.

Mountain biking has been a part of my life ever since I was big enough to ride a bike. It's evolved from weekend rides up Five Corners with my dad to cruising over to Alpine Dam with my friends. Whether I'm pushing myself or just taking it easy, mountain biking is a great escape from the stress that comes with being in high school. With so much to figure out and so many things to do, finding time to step back can be hard, and mountain biking provides a space for me to do that. Not only do I get a respite from the woes of teenage life, but I also get to spend time with amazing people. The mountain biking community has always been there for me, even when I didn't know it. I've met some of my closest friends and had some of the best times riding my bike, and I can't imagine my life without my feet clipped into pedals.
