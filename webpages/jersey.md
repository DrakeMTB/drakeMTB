Race Jersey and Shorts (aka Team Kit) – Order deadline November 25, 2015

**EVERYONE** needs a **new jersey** this year. The **previous jersey** will **not suffice** in the races but you are welcome to continue to **wear** it for **training** rides.

The **shorts** are **optional** but most choose to purchase at least both the jersey and the shorts. The NorCal League and individual teams negotiate a great discount on the kits, however they are still expensive. The rider only needs one kit but is welcome to order as much as they want. And, the kits are not limited to racers; anyone is welcome to place an order.

There are 2 versions of the jersey. The TEAM is the slimmer cut, race fit jersey, with raglan sleeves. The TRAINING is the fuller cut jersey with set-in sleeves. 
L/S is short for Long Sleeve

Every 2 years, kits are redesigned and new sponsor logos are added. Currently, the kits are scheduled to be redesigned on even years; 2016, 2018… So, if your child doesn’t grow out of their kit, it can possibly be used for 2 years. 

This is a new vendor. Previously we used Capo and now we are switching to Castelli.
